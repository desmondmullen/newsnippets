# newsnippets

**NewSNippets is an exercise in full stack development skills with a focus on Express, MongoDB, Axios, and Cheerio.** I created this for the Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill in April 2019.

# Features

NewSNippets scrapes news articles from the New York Times and allows users to save articles (like "favorites") and make notes to attach to articles. Multiple notes can be created for any one article. Notes can easily be deleted, as well.

In addition to the requirements of the assignment, I used radio buttons and toggle switches for clarity in the user interface making it unmistakeable whether an article is saved or not and whether the user is viewing All the articles or only the Saved ones. I also added a Search feature for searching through all the articles. This implementation of search allows for multi-word and case-insensitive searches. Searching for nothing - leaving the search field blank - retrieves all articles.
